### Barriers to Training

There are differences in the numbers of barriers faced by an applicant depending on the applicants race and income. White applicants are more likely to face little obstacles compared to their colored counterparts, this pattern applies to wealthier applicants. This relationship was not statistically significant though. 

| Barrier/State        | Minnesota      | Oregon        |
| :---                 |     :---:      |          ---: |
| Time                 | 19             | 25            |
| Training Fees        | 28             | 30            |
| Distance to Training | 6              | 14            |
| Lack of Knowledge    | 4              | 9             |

The most notable barriers to training, time and training fees, transcend slight state legistlation differences. Key solutions according to informational interviews 
include reviving the grandfather clause (allowing previous experience as a substitute for training) and expanding the centers that are allowed to provide official training. 


### Barriers to Completing Application

There are differences in the numbers of barriers faced by an applicant depending on the applicants race. White applicants are more likely to face little obstacles compared to their colored counterparts. This relationship was not statistically significant though. No relationship exists for income because of the lack of participants with higher incomes. 

| Barrier/State           | Minnesota      | Oregon        |
| :---                    |     :---:      |          ---: |
| Lack of State Response  | 11             | 28            |
| Lack of Community List  |                | 3             |
| Lack of Tech            |                | 8             |
| Lack of Experience      |                | 7             |
| Lack of Documents       |                | 3             |
| Application Fee         | 11             | N/A           |

Minnesota and Oregon had drastically different barriers for completing and submitting the application. For both states participants reported that the states lack of response and communication was the most significant obstacle. Minnesota's process required less materials than but has a $200 applicantion fee. Oregon required more materials but the lack of appropriate technology to complete digital trainings and mandatory experience posed difficulties.
