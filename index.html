title: How to Maternal Mortality with Doulas?
subtitle: Maternal mortality has been steadily declining worldwide, with one significant outlier: the United States. It is only 1 out of the 8 countries that has seen an increase. Particularly, women of color are at a greater risk for preterm deliveries, smaller babies, preeclampsia and high blood pressure and  3-4 times more likely to die for pregnancy-related reasons than white women. During a woman’s pregnancy, a doula (trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to a mother) can mitigate these disparities and contribute to lower healthcare costs. Recognizing doulas’ benefits, Minnesota and Oregon began providing Medicaid coverage for doulas in 2014. Since then, 19 states have at least proposed similar action.  However, according to the Center for American Progress, some community based doulas believe the credentialing, training, and registration requirements under such legislation may serve to exclude doulas of color and low income doulas, hence weakening community based programs targeting low income areas of colored women through “peer” doulas. Peer doulas are doulas who share a background with their patient. 
subtitle: This project seeks to answer the question if whether the legislation that provides Medicaid reimbursements for doulas pose additional barriers for doulas from underserved backgrounds?
