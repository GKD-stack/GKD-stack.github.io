# Methods Overview 
There were 2 core phases of this project: informational interviews as well as data collection and analysis. 

## Informational Interviews
11 people were interviewed at the beginning of this project. The interviewees consisted of doulas, nonprofit leaders, doula trainers, and insurance liaisons.

Additionally, The Childbirth Collective, a nonprofit in Minnesota, also provided a dataset from 2011-to 2018 with over 6000 doulas reporting their most recent birth. Key results can be found here.

The informational interviews were conducted in a semistructured format. They were approximately 30-45 minutes in length and participants were offered 20 dollars in the form of an Amazon gift card as compensation. The interviews were analyzed through a traditional thematic coding method. All participants were given the choice to stay anonymous. 

The interview guide can be found here. 


## Data Collection
The 5-7 minute survey was created in Qualtrics with both multiple choice and free response questions. A $5 compensation in the form of a Starbucks gift card was offered to each participant who completed the survey. This survey was distributed through email and social media. Not all questions were required, particularly free-response questions. 130 participants were used in the final analysis.

Data analysis was conducted through Python in Jupyter Notebooks and R Studio.
